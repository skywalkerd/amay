# `amay`

Little CLI software to handle development environment

## Purpose

The primary purpose of `amay` is to ease the management and creation of development
environment for developers of any kind (_web_, _devops_). Throught `providers`, such
as _Vagrant_ or _Digital Ocean_, a developer can create machines. These machines
can be orchestrated throught `orchestrators`, such as _Puppet_ or _SaltStack_. A
developer will be able to launch production-like network environment spawn across
those `providers`.

## Roadmap

A roadmap is near to come.
